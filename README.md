# OpenCV-Projects
A number of OpenCV projects are scripted: Image and Video Manipulation, Image and Video Thresholding, Color Thresholding. More info at Readme file.

# Script 1 - opencv_image_manipulation_encrypted_painting.py
In this script a string message is encrypted into the Mona Lisa painting and then decrypted:

# Script 2 - opencv_video_manipulation_recording_and_live.py
In this script several manipulations are made in a pre-recorded video and also live, from my computer camera!

# Script 3 - thresholds_image_identification.py
In this script a sample image of footballs is being grayscaled, blurred and segmented in order to recognize how many footballs exist inside the image!

# Script 4 - thresholds_video_identification.py
In this script i recorded a video with 2 black balls sitting on my desk and then again grayscaled, blurred and segmented the video frames in a loop to determine how many black balls are on my table! After all a video is a compilation of image frames !!

# Script 5 - color_thresholding.py
In this script a sample image of colored balls is presented and then blurred without being grayscaled, in order to determine how many blue balls exist in the image.
